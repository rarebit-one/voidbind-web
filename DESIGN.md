# DESIGN — voidbind-web

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-31

A short design record for the `@rarebit-one/voidbind-web` package: why it is its
own repo, the wire contract it speaks, and its deliberately narrow scope.

## Why a separate repo

`voidbind-web` is the **browser/web protocol-client** for Voidbind login, split
out of All Thing's in-app `web/signin.html` + `web/app.js`. It gets its own repo
for the same reasons `voidbind-kmp` (the native authenticator) is separate from
`voidbind-go` (the server):

- **Consumed by N repos.** The two Tizen `.wgt` surfaces (allthing-tizen,
  heyarr-tizen) and future browser web clients all need the identical
  start → QR → poll → token flow. A shared, versioned package beats copying the
  logic into each surface (which is how it drifted before — allthing had its own
  copy).
- **npm-publishable.** A JS package belongs on the GitHub Packages npm registry
  (`@rarebit-one` scope), so consumers `npm install` a pinned version rather than
  vendoring source.
- **Symmetric peer of `voidbind-kmp`.** The topology is intentionally three
  repos: `voidbind-go` (server + wire contract, the source of truth),
  `voidbind-kmp` (native authenticator — the device that approves), and
  `voidbind-web` (the browser/web relying-party client). Each RP language surface
  is its own consumer library.
- **Keeps `voidbind-go`'s CI clean.** A JS package with a Node test job doesn't
  belong in the Go module's build; separating it keeps each repo's CI single-stack
  (Go stays Go, this stays Node).

## The contract it speaks (ADR-0006)

The module mirrors — does not invent — the `weblogin.Broker` HTTP contract from
[allthing `docs/adr/0006-voidbind-web-login.md`](https://github.com/rarebit-one/allthing/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-voidbind-web-login.md),
as exercised by allthing's `web/signin.html`. The wire shapes themselves are
voidbind-go's `weblogin/handler.go` (`createResp`, `pollResp`), the source of truth:

```
POST {baseUrl}/login                   -> { id, qr }
POST {baseUrl}/login?mode=number-match -> { id, qr, match_number }
GET  {baseUrl}/login/{id}              -> { status: 'pending'|'approved'|'expired', token?, user? }
                                          (404 once the broker no longer knows the login)
```

- `qr` is the `voidbind:login?rp=<origin>&id=<login-id>` payload the broker mints
  (byte-identical to voidbind-go's `weblogin.EncodeLogin`); the client only
  displays it — it never constructs the tuple.
- On `approved`, the poll response carries the short-lived **session token** and
  the authenticated `user`.
- The token is carried as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for `fetch` and, for
  the SSE live route whose `EventSource` cannot set a header, as `?token=<token>`.
  A short-lived per-login token is a fine query token: it is already rotated
  every login, which is exactly the leak mitigation the separate-SSE-token rule
  reached for.
- The **broker is the authority on expiry**. It returns `status: 'expired'` once
  its ChallengeTTL (ADR-0006) lapses, so the client polls until a terminal
  status rather than running a local timeout clock. The create response carries
  no expiry timestamp, so there is nothing to count down against.
- **Number-matching (voidbind-go ADR-0006 v2) is opt-in** (`numberMatch: true`).
  The create response's `match_number` is the true number. This module surfaces
  it as `matchNumber` for the caller to display, because this browser is the one
  screen the legitimate user is looking at. The phone receives only the
  candidates. Without the option the request carries no `mode`, so existing
  consumers get an unchanged v1 login.

### Where the wire forced a detail

- allthing's `signin.html` uses the wire field names `id` and `qr`. This module
  keeps the wire names on the boundary but exposes them to callers as
  `loginId` / `qrPayload` (and `match_number` as `matchNumber`).
- voidbind-go has no `denied` status: a failed approval (wrong number, unknown
  device) leaves the login `pending` so the honest device can still approve, and
  only `expired` ends it. This module still treats a `status: 'denied'` as a
  reject so a non-voidbind-go RP that adds one fails fast. Against voidbind-go
  that branch never fires.

## Scope

- **QR-only, no push.** ADR-0009 (device push approval) is explicitly out of
  scope: a Tizen `.wgt` is a QR surface. The flow is start → show QR → poll.
- **Framework-free and tiny.** No runtime dependencies, no build step, plain ESM.
  The only bundled code is the vendored `qrcode-generator` (MIT) under
  `src/vendor/` — self-hosted, never a CDN (ADR-0001), so a `.wgt` runs offline.
- **RP-agnostic.** `baseUrl` is injected; no allthing- or heyarr-specific code
  lives here.

## License

AGPL-3.0-or-later, consistent with `voidbind-kmp` and `heyarr-core`. The repo is
private today; the license is written as if public, pending a "make public"
go-ahead.

# Fails if the golden vectors under test/vectors/ have drifted from
# void-which-binds-go's testvectors/vectors/ at the commit pinned in
# test/vectors/VOID_WHICH_BINDS_GO_REF.
#
# void-which-binds-go is the single source of truth for Void-Which-Binds protocol
# vectors (its `testvectors` package); this repo carries a verbatim copy of the
# directories the WebAuthn signer replays (webauthn/, delegation/, approval/,
# scope/). Each copied directory must equal upstream's byte for byte, README
# included; directories this repo does not use are not copied. Never edit a
# copied vector here: re-copy it from void-which-binds-go and bump the pin in the
# same change. (Mirrors void-which-binds-kmp's scripts/check-vector-drift.sh.)
#
# Env:
#   VOID_WHICH_BINDS_GO_TOKEN  token that can read the (private) void-which-binds-go
#                              repo over HTTPS; optional when git already has
#                              credentials.
#   VOID_WHICH_BINDS_GO_URL    clone URL or local path (default: the GitHub repo).
